Problems I faced:

1. Didn't stick to plan - decided to go from bootstrap to material - a lot of time wasted learning the new library
2. A lot of angular related tutorials are not using strict mode, takes a lot of time figuring out how to type declarations properly.
3. Again, documentations don't usually contain strict typing!!!!!
4. Branch, branch, branch. Commit, commit, commit.
5. Branch for small features, don't go down rabbit hole!
6.
