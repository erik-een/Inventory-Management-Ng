Features for users:
1. Enterprise accounts.
2. Secure login/auth system

Users can

rate companies, but any rating below 3 is between the company and client, hidden, until both parties have the opportunity to resolve the issue first, with a timeout of 2 weeks to avoid rating abuse on both ends and have a report feature so for real people to see if someone is just abusing the rating system to downrate companies

* Add items to their companies' inventory.

* Check them out of the inventory for use/renting temporarily and have history of where the items went.

* Return the items back into inventory after use and can confirm it on the page. 

* Reserve items for checkout. 

* Do inventory to see if numbers match.

* Remove items from the inventory, either as lost items/liquidization etc.

* Schedule inventory movement and see if they have enough inventory to rent out and a warning if current checkout will compromise another scheduled checkout.
